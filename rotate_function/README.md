**Class Definition:**

* `class Solution { ... }`: Defines a class named `Solution` containing the logic for finding the maximum value of the rotation function.

**Public Method:**

* `int maxRotateFunction(vector<int>& nums)`: This public method takes a reference to a vector of integers (`nums`) and returns the maximum value obtained by applying a specific rotation function.

**Function explanation:**

1. **Handle empty array:**
   - `if (nums.size() == 0) return 0;`: Checks if the input vector is empty. If so, the function returns 0 (no elements to rotate).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `int sum = 0`: Initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of all elements in the array.
   - `int prev = 0`: Initializes a variable `prev` to store a value used in the rotation function calculation (explained later).
   - `int mx = INT_MIN`: Initializes a variable `mx` to store the maximum value encountered so far.

3. **Calculate initial values:**
   - `for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) { ... }`: This loop iterates through each element (`nums[i]`) in the vector.
      - `sum += nums[i]`: Accumulates the sum of all elements.
      - `prev += i * nums[i]`: Calculates a value based on the element's index and its value. This value is used later in the rotation function calculation.

4. **Dynamic Programming (DP) approach:**
   - `vector<int> dp(nums.size(), -1);`: Creates a vector `dp` of size `nums.size()` initialized with -1. This vector will store intermediate results for efficiency using Dynamic Programming (DP).
   - `dp[0] = prev;`: Sets the first element of `dp` to the value of `prev` calculated earlier (represents the initial state without rotation). This is the base case for the DP approach.
   - `mx = dp[0];`: Updates `mx` with the initial value.

5. **Iterate and update DP:**
   - `for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) { ... }`: This loop iterates from the second element (`i = 1`) to the last element of the vector.
      - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + sum - nums.size() * nums[nums.size() - i]`: This line performs the core calculation of the DP approach. It leverages the previously calculated value `dp[i-1]` (represents the maximum value for a rotation ending at the previous element) and updates it for the current element (`i`).
         - `sum - nums.size() * nums[nums.size() - i]`: This part calculates the difference between the total sum and the product of the array size and the current element's value at the "end" after a one-position rotation.

6. **Find maximum:**
   - `mx = max(mx, dp[i]);`: After calculating the value for the current rotation ending at element `i`, this line compares it with the current maximum value (`mx`) and updates `mx` if necessary.

7. **Return result:**
   - `return mx;`: After iterating through all elements, the function returns the final value stored in `mx`, which represents the maximum value obtained by applying the rotation function to the array.

**Main Function:**

* This part takes input for the number of elements (`n`) and reads the elements into a vector `v`.
* It creates an object of class `Solution` and calls the `maxRotateFunction` method with the `v` vector.
* The result is printed, and the program exits.

**Rotation Function:**

The concept behind the rotation function is a bit complex. Imagine rotating the array by one position to the right. The function calculates a value based on this rotation. It considers the sum of all elements and the product of each element's index and its value in the original position. By cleverly manipulating these values, the function essentially captures the impact of rotation on the "fitness" of the array and finds the rotation that leads to the maximum value.

The DP approach helps efficiently calculate the maximum value for different rotations by building upon previously computed values.
