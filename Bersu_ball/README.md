1. **Include headers and namespace:**
   - `<bits/stdc++.h>`: This header file includes commonly used libraries in C++.
   - `using namespace std;`: This avoids repeatedly writing `std::` before standard library elements.

2. **Define data type:**
   - `ll long long int`: Defines an alias `ll` for the `long long int` data type, commonly used for larger integers.

3. **Main function:**
   - `int main()`: This is the entry point of the program.

4. **Input number of boys (n) and their skills:**
   - `cin >> n`: Reads the number of boys (`n`) from standard input.
   - `int a[n]`: Declares an array `a` of size `n` to store the dancing skills of boys.
   - `for` loop: Iterates `n` times to read each boy's skill and store it in `a[i]`.

5. **Input number of girls (m) and their skills:**
   - Similar to steps for boys, this part reads the number of girls (`m`) and their skills into an array `b`.

6. **Sorting boys' and girls' skills:**
   - `sort(a, a + n)`: Sorts the `a` array in ascending order using the `sort` function.
   - `sort(b, b + m)`: Sorts the `b` array in ascending order.

7. **Counting valid pairs:**
   - `int cnt = 0`: Initializes a counter variable `cnt` to store the number of valid pairs.
   - Nested `for` loop: Iterates over each boy (`i`) and each girl (`j`).
      - `if (abs(a[i] - b[j]) <= 1)`: Checks if the absolute difference between skills is less than or equal to 1.
         - `cnt++`: Increments the counter if the condition is met.
         - `b[j] = 500`: This is a clever optimization to avoid revisiting the same girl for other boys. Assigning a large value (like 500) ensures this girl won't be a valid match for anyone with lower skill levels.

8. **Print result and exit:**
   - `cout << cnt << '\n'`: Prints the final count of valid pairs (`cnt`) followed by a newline.
   - `return 0;`: Indicates successful program termination.

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum number of pairs by keeping the boys' skills sorted and using a nested loop to compare them with girls' skills. The optimization with `b[j] = 500` helps reduce redundant comparisons.
